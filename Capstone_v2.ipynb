              " 'what you tell yourself about a situation affects how you feel and what you do. sometimes your interpretation of a situation can get distorted and you only focus on the negative aspectsthis is normal and expected. however, when you interpret situations too negatively, you might feel worse. you\\'re also more likely to respond to the situation in ways that are unhelpful in the long term. these automatic thoughts and assumptions are sometimes called thinking traps. everyone falls into unbalanced thinking traps from time to time. you\\'re most likely to distort your interpretation of things when you already feel sad, angry, anxious, depressed or stressed. you\\'re also more vulnerable to thinking traps when you\\'re not taking good care of yourself, like when you\\'re not eating or sleeping well. here are some common thinking traps: thinking that a negative situation is part of a constant cycle of bad things that happen. people who overgeneralize often use words like \"always\" or \"never.\" i was really looking forward to that concert, and now its cancelled. this always happens to me! i never get to do fun things! seeing things as only right or wrong, good or bad, perfect or terrible. people who think in black and white terms see a small mistake as a total failure. i wanted to eat healthier, but i ate too many snacks today. this plan is a total failure! saying only negative things about yourself or other people. i made a mistake. i\\'m stupid! my boss told me that i made a mistake. my boss is a total jerk! predicting that something bad will happen without any evidence. i\\'ve been doing what i can to stay home and reduce the risks, but i just know that i\\'m going to get sick. focusing only on the negative parts of a situation and ignoring anything good or positive. i know there\\'s a lot i can do at home, but i\\'m just so sick of this. everything is terrible. believing that bad feelings or emotions reflect the situation. i feel scared and overwhelmed right now, so that must mean everything is very bad and will never get better. telling yourself how you \"should\" or \"must\" act. i should be able to handle this without getting upset and crying! here are helpful strategies to challenge common thinking traps. many people find their mood and confidence improve after working through these skills. you can also find worksheets to help you go through each step at www.heretohelp.bc.ca. don\\'t try to get out of a thinking trap by just telling yourself to stop thinking that way. this doesn\\'t let you look at the evidence and challenge the thinking trap. when you try and push upsetting thoughts away, they are more likely to keep popping back into your mind. ask yourself the following questions when something upsetting happens: what is the situation? what actually happened? only include facts that everyone would agree on. what are your thoughts? what are you telling yourself? what are your emotions? how do you feel? what are your behaviours? how are you reacting? what are you doing to cope? take a look at the thoughts you\\'ve listed. are you using any of the thinking traps and falling into distorted thinking patterns? it\\'s common to fall into more than one thinking trap. go back to the thinking trap list and identify which ones apply to you and your current situation. the best way to break a thinking trap is to look at your thoughts like a scientist and consider the hard facts. use the evidence you\\'ve collected to challenge your thinking traps. here are some ways to do that: try to find evidence against the thought. if you make a mistake at work, you might automatically think, \"i can\\'t do anything right! i must be a terrible employee!\" when this thought comes up, you might challenge it by asking, \"is there any evidence to support this thought? is there any evidence to disprove this thought?\" you might quickly realize that your boss has complimented your work recently, which doesn\\'t support the idea that you\\'re a bad employee. ask yourself, \"would i judge other people if they did the same thing? am i being harder on myself than i am on other people?\" this is a great method for challenging thinking traps that involve harsh self-criticism. find out whether other people you trust agree with your thoughts. for example, you might have trouble with one of your kids and think, \"good parents wouldn\\'t have this kind of problem.\" to challenge this thought, you can ask other parents if they\\'ve ever had any problems with their kids. test your beliefs in person. for example, if you think that your friends don\\'t care about you, call a few friends and make plans to start a regular video call. if you assumed that they will all say no, you may be pleasantly surprised to hear that they do want to see you. once you have worked through some challenges, try to think of a more balanced thought to replace the old thinking traps. let\\'s use the following example: i feel sad and overwhelmed. i\\'m having a hard time figuring out what to do. i\\'m the worst! i should be able to handle this! labeling \\'should\\' statements examine the evidence: i have a lot of challenges right now. i\\'m worried about my family and everything seems to change so quickly. i\\'ve successfully handled complicated situations in the past, so i know i can do this. it\\'s okay to feel upset right nowthere\\'s a lot going on. i\\'m going to think about how i got through past situations and see what worked for me. i\\'m trying to do a lot on my own, so i\\'m going to talk to my family so we can make a plan and work together. try the healthy thinking worksheet at www.heretohelp.bc.ca check out anxiety canada\\'s articles helpful thinking and thinking traps this page is adapted from wellness module 8: healthy thinking at www.heretohelp.bc.ca/wellness-module/wellness-module-8-healthy-thinking.',\n",

              " 'sorting out if you are drinking too much can be complicated. you are unique and your relationship with alcohol is unique. no one has the same combination of life experiences and influences that you do. so even though you and your friend may choose to drink, how and why you use alcohol may be different. those of us who drink, seek benefits from alcohol, not difficulties. but sometimes we start using more, and more often, than makes sense. as a general rule, drinking alcohol becomes a problem when it negatively affects our life or the lives of others. many people imagine this refers to people who consume alcohol all day every day. but even drinking too much on a single occasion can lead to a problem, for instance making a poor decision such as driving while impaired. whats also important to recognize is the potential for negative consequences related to drinking in various contexts (i.e., places, times and activities) and over time (e.g., coping with chronic problems). you can get personalized feedback related to your pattern of drinking as compared to canadas low-risk alcohol drinking guidelines via the alcohol reality check screening app. this short, simple screen can be used by people of all ages. all alcohol use involves some risk. the reasons people use alcohol can influence their risk of developing problems. for instance, if a person uses alcohol to enhance special celebrations, only occasional social use may follow. but when a person drinks to cope with a long-term problem such as social anxiety, then more long lasting and intense use may follow. by reflecting on your pattern of drinking you can manage your risk for immediate injury or death, your chances for long-term health consequences such as cancer or heart disease, and your risk of developing habitual patterns of drinking that may lead to these harms. whenever you decide to drink alcohol, it is helpful to know what steps you can take to ensure that your drinking behaviour is the most rewarding and least harmful possible. the following are some useful guidelines to consider. not too much. managing how much you drink on a given occasion helps decrease risky behaviours. tip: drink slowly and alternate between non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. not too often. drinking in moderation helps to reduce harms to ourselves and others over time. tip: keep less alcohol at home and set limits on how much you are going to drink each week, avoiding drinking on some days. only in safe contexts. making informed decisions about where you drink helps to minimize alcohol-related harm. tip: if going to a bar, stay with a group and choose an establishment that is well lit and near safe transportation options. for information on treatment options and resources throughout bc, call the alcohol and drug information referral service at 1-800-663-1441. in greater vancouver, call 604-660-9382. to better understand how substances play a role in your life, visit the you and substance use workbook on the heretohelp website. the canadian institute for substance use research, formerly carbc, is a member of the bc partners for mental health and addictions information. the institute is dedicated to the study of substance use in support of community-wide efforts aimed at providing all people with access to healthier lives, whether using substances or not. for more, visit www.cisur.ca.',\n",
              " 'cannabis smoke, for example, contains cancer-causing toxins. however, the risk of developing some cancers (e.g., mouth, tongue and lung) is less for cannabis smokers than tobacco smokers, partly because they tend to smoke less than tobacco users. and, while all drugs have an effect on the brain, the particular properties of the drug influence the level of risk of harmful consequences. the negative effects of cannabis on the brain, for example, seem to be less than the effects of some substances such as alcohol. legalizing cannabis provides an opportunity to put in place regulations to minimize potential harms. the danger of buying and using any illegal drug is that we can never know for sure what exactly is in it. cannabis is legal in canada as of october 17, 2018. adults (over age 19 in bc) are now permitted to possess up to 30 grams of cannabis in public. cannabis is regulated by the province of british columbia and will be sold through the liquor distribution branch. cannabis will be tested for quality. when drugs are produced and obtained inside a regulated system, it is possible for us to know about the contents and dosage of what we are taking. this helps us manage the risks. however, it is likely that cannabis will still be available outside the government system. it is important to know that the quality of cannabis obtained from a dealer or a friend is unknown and may contain contaminants like mold, mildew, or fillers that may be toxic. the legalization of cannabis also provides us with openings to engage in honest and thoughtful discussions about drug use with our families and communities. when dealing with complex issues, like cannabis policy, no one has all the answers. but as community members, we all have thoughts, feelings and experiences around drugs and drug use to share with each other. engaging together to explore and share ideas will help us discover how to manage use, as individuals and communities, in ways that maximize benefit and minimize harm. the canadian institute for substance use research, formerly carbc, is a member of the bc partners for mental health and addictions information. the institute is dedicated to the study of substance use in support of community-wide efforts aimed at providing all people with access to healthier lives, whether using substances or not. for more, visit www.cisur.ca.',\n",

              " \"cannabidiol or cbd is a naturally occurring component of cannabis. it is extracted from the cannabis plant and often made into an oil for use. cbd is not psychoactive, and does not produce the high of thc (tetrahyrocannabinol), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. cbd is legal in canada and has been used in the treatment of various medical conditions. all cannabinoids, including cbd, produce effects in the body by attaching to certain receptors in the brain or immune system. the human body also produces its own cannabinoids. it seems that cbd does not attach directly to receptors. instead, it directs the body to use more of its own cannabinoids to produce the therapeutic effects associated with cbd. research suggests that cbd may provide relief for chronic pain. sativex is a proprietary medication that combines thc and cbd and may be prescribed for the relief of pain associated with multiple sclerosis. there is also some evidence suggesting that cbd may be a promising support for people with opioid use disorders. the researchers noted that cbd reduced some symptoms associated with substance use disorders including anxiety, mood-related symptoms, pain, and insomnia. after researching the safety and effectiveness of cbd oil for treating epilepsy, in 2018, the united states fda approved cbd (epidiolex) as a therapy for two rare conditions characterized by epileptic seizures. other evidence suggests that cbd may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia, though further research is needed before introducing cbd into medical practice. there is some initial evidence that cbd may help people in the early stages of alzheimer's disease keep the ability to recognize the faces of people that they know, and thus slow progression of the illness. again, more research is needed in this area. because of the way cannabis and its products are metabolized, scientists believe there is a potential for interaction with other drugs, although nothing significant has yet been recorded. cbd has been found to be generally safe. reports from patients indicate that negative drug interactions are not common. as with any other treatment, it is important to monitor your use of cbd and seek assistance if you experience any problems or have questions or concerns about its use. the canadian institute for substance use research, formerly carbc, is a member of the bc partners for mental health and addictions information. the institute is dedicated to the study of substance use in support of community-wide efforts aimed at providing all people with access to healthier lives, whether using substances or not. for more, visit www.cisur.ca.\",\n",
              " '\"vaping\" is the term for using a device where liquids, often flavoured, are turned into vapour (hence, vaping) and inhaled. a vaping device consists of a mouthpiece, tank or reservoir to hold the liquid, a heating element and a battery to power the element. the liquid is heated to become a mist, inhaled through the mouth into the lungs where the nicotine or cannabis enters the bloodstream. any residual vapour is exhaled. vaping devices come in several types, shapes, and sizes, referred to as e-cigarettes, vape pens, vapes, mods, tanks, or e-hookahs. vaping liquid (e-liquid, e-juice) consists of a solvent, usually propylene glycol or glycerol, flavour, and nicotine or cannabis, though it may not contain anything. in british columbia you must be 19 years old to buy vaping products. the number of young people who smoke cigarettes has declined over the past few years, while vaping has increased. e-cigarettes were developed as an alternative to smoking. the first devices were available in 2003 and looked much like a traditional cigarette. nicotine vapour contains significantly fewer toxins and other particles than smoke from cigarettes. vaping is a less harmful alternative to cigarettes and evidence suggests, it may help some people quit smoking. evidence suggests vaping is likely not a gateway to smoking tobacco. though less harmful than smoking cigarettes, vaping still carries potential harms. there is a small exposure to nicotine and possible carcinogens in the vapour. (a carcinogen is a substance that has the potential to cause cancer). some evidence suggests that young people may be unaware the vaping liquid often contains nicotine. e-cigarettes are not controlled and the nicotine content of vaping liquids varies significantly among brands. other chemicals, flavourings, and heavy metals present in vaping liquids, have not as yet been well studied. long-term health risks from vaping are thus undetermined. more research is needed in these areas. marketing strategies for vaping products, often on social media, are designed to appeal to young people. the range of flavours available, especially those that are fruity and sweet, and the look and feel of vaping devices attract youth. young people can see vaping as fun and a way to socialize with friends and \\'smoke\\' in a less harmful way. making the time and space for discussion and exploring the issues around vaping is one important way we can support young people and indeed, each other, in making good decisions about if, when, or how much to vape. we offer, \"not too much, not too often, and in a safe context\" as one way to think about using any substance. what this means to you may be a place for talking to start! the canadian institute for substance use research, formerly carbc, is a member of the bc partners for mental health and addictions information. the institute is dedicated to the study of substance use in support of community-wide efforts aimed at providing all people with access to healthier lives, whether using substances or not. for more, visit www.cisur.ca.']"
